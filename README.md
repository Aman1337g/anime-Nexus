# Anime Nexus

Hey there! Welcome to my Anime Nexus. This project is all about bringing you a modern and exciting way to explore various anime titles. I've built this Next.js server-side application with a bunch of cool features, making your anime journey more enjoyable.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Experience faster page loads and better SEO as I've implemented server-side rendering with Next.js.

- **Server Actions:** I've made sure to fetch data efficiently from the Shikimori API on the server side. This not only improves performance but also lightens the load on your end.

- **Infinite Scroll:** Scroll through a diverse collection of anime titles seamlessly. No need to click through pages; just keep scrolling, and more content will load for you.

- **Framer Motion Animations:** Get ready for a visually stunning experience with smooth animations powered by Framer Motion. It adds that extra flair to the user interface, making your exploration more enjoyable.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anime-Nexus.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Configure API keys:

   Get your Shikimori API key and add it to the configuration file.

## Technologies Used

Here's a quick rundown of the technologies I've used:

- **Next.js:** A fantastic React-based framework that powers up this app with server-side rendering and other performance goodies.

- **Shikimori API:** I've tapped into this API to bring you a vast database of anime information, ensuring you get the latest and greatest content.

- **Framer Motion:** For those smooth and interactive animations that add that extra oomph to your experience.
